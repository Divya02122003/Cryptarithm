# Cryptarithm
Successfully designed and developed a scalable hardware prototype called Cryptarithm to perform sophisticated arithmetic operations for encryption/decryption and other algorithms. In a general-purpose system where software cryptography is implemented, there are more ways to snoop and access to vital information. Whereas in a hardware system, special care is taken to hide and protect the vital information such as private keys to make it much more difficult to access.
The rapid growth of the IoT sector has exposed vulnerabilities in device security. The proposed IC is designed to support low-power IoT devices with localized encryption, offering moderate to low-level security.

A dedicated IC for Cryptarithm could revolutionize encryption algorithms and improve data security in industrial applications.

This hardware-based prototype provides considerable speed and energy efficiency gains over software-based solutions.

Delving into the the advantages of hardware-based prototype over software-based solutions, 11 individually verified arithmetic modules has been integrated into a single platform of which two of the individual modules have been shown below. Depending on the requirement, the scaling of the input and output pins can be done.

Successfully implemented and verified on the Nexys4 DDR FPGA platform.

Designed and synthesized for ASIC implementation using SAED 32nm standard cell libraries. Complete design synthesized and verified through all stages using the Synopsys Design Compiler tool, including parasitic and layout optimization to generate GDS files.

The design operates with a clock signal of 100 MHz, adjustable based on user requirements. Achieved total power consumption of <5mW, significantly lower than a typical AND gate (7408) DIP IC (~300mW). Observed area of <6500 µm² and CPD of <3ns.

FPGA and ASIC results set benchmarks for future research, enabling further optimization and eventual tape-out of the prototype.
